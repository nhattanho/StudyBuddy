# StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy is a web application that matches students with similar interests as accountability partners. Users will be able to schedule zoom study sessions with their “study buddy”, and be better motivated to complete their tasks when studying together. Users can also find new connections, saving past study buddies as friends, and message each other outside of the study session.
